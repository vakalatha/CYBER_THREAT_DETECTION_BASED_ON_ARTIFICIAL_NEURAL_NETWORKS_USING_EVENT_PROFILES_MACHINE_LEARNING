Cyber attacks aim to disable, disrupt, destroy or control computer systems or to alter, block, delete, manipulate or steal the data held within these systems.Any individual or group can launch a cyber attack from anywhere by using one or more various attack strategies.People who carry out cyber attacks are generally regarded as cybercriminals. Often referred to as bad actors, threat actors and hackers, they include individuals who act alone, drawing on their computer skills to design and execute malicious attacks. They can also belong to a criminal syndicate, working with other threat actors to find weaknesses or problems in the computer systems -- called vulnerabilities -- that they can exploit for criminal gain.Government-sponsored groups of computer experts also launch cyber attacks. They're identified as nation-state attackers, and they have been accused of attacking the information technology (IT) infrastructure of other governments, as well as nongovernment entities, such as businesses, nonprofits and utilities.Other financially motivated attacks are designed to disable computer systems, with cybercriminals locking computers so owners and authorized users cannot access the applications or data they need; attackers then demand that the targeted organizations pay them ransoms to unlock the computer systems.Still, other attacks aim to gain valuable corporate data, such as propriety information; these types of cyber attacks are a modern, computerized form of corporate espionage.Bad actors also launch attacks specifically to sow chaos, confusion, discontent, frustration or mistrust. They could be taking such action as a way to get revenge for acts taken against them. They could be aiming to publicly embarrass the attacked entities or to damage the organizations' reputations. These attacks are often directed at government entities but can also hit commercial entities or nonprofit organizations.Nation-state attackers are behind some of these types of attacks. Others, called hacktivists, might launch these types of attacks as a form of protest against the targeted entity; a secretive decentralized group of internationalist activists known as Anonymous is the most well known of such groups.In an untargeted attack, where the bad actors are trying to break into as many devices or systems as possible, they generally look for vulnerabilities in software code that will enable them to gain access without being detected or blocked. Or, they might employ a phishing attack, emailing large numbers of people with socially engineered messages crafted to entice recipients to click a link that will download malicious code.In a targeted attack, the threat actors are going after a specific organization, and the methods used vary depending on the attack's objectives. The hacktivist group Anonymous, for example, was suspected in a 2020 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on the Minneapolis Police Department website after a Black man died while being arrested by Minneapolis officers. Hackers also use spear-phishing campaigns in a targeted attack, crafting emails to specific individuals who, if they click included links, would download malicious software designed to subvert the organization's technology or the sensitive data it holds.</p>
